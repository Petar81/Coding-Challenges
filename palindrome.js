// Challenge: check if a String is a Palindrome - reads the same backwards & forwards.
// Problem: find the same forwards/backwards reading pattern in one single String. 
// Solution: Implement a function that takes a String & logs Palindrome if a word reads the same backwards & forwards.



// SOLUTION IN PSEUDOCODE

// - Define a String to be checked against the algorithm.
// - Reverse an input String and save it as a local variable & then compare it with the original input String.
// - Bake a function that will take a String as an input, apply the afore mentioned algorithm & print out a reulst.
