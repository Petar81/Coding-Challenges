// Challenge: Sum up integers from a text file, line by line.
// Problem: Numbers are in a different (input) file scattered across multiple lines.
// Solution: Implement a function that takes file as an input, reads it line by line and sums all the numbers.



// SOLUTION IN PSEUDOCODE

// - Define an input field (input file).
// - Identify file reader function/class, identify string split method, identify parse number/integer method. 
// - Bake a function that'll take a file as an input, parse it line by line and sum all the numbers.
